**HttpClient Demo with Product API Integration**

This project demonstrates the effective use of HttpClientFactory in a .NET 8.0 application to fetch and display products from the FakeStoreAPI. It showcases a simple and scalable architecture for making HTTP calls and rendering data on a front-end.

**Key Concepts**
Custom HttpClient Service: Implements **HttpClientService** for API requests.
GET Operation: Fetches product data via the FakeStore API.
Product API: Exposes the data to front-end screens through API **/Products.**
JavaScript Fetch: Utilizes JavaScript's fetch function in Razor views to retrieve and display products dynamically.
Interactive UI: Displays products in tile format, with clickable images for an enlarged view.


**Features**
Framework: .NET 8.0
API: FakeStoreAPI
